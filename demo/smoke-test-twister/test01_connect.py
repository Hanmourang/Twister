# <description>This suite checks a lot of things.
# It checks if the EPs are running the tests successfully and it calls all CE functions, to ensure they work as expected.
# This file is checking if the suite runs from Twister.</description>

# `PROXY`, `USER`, `SUITE_NAME` and `FILE_NAME` are magic variables, from the Runner.

# Must have one of the statuses:
# 'pass', 'fail', 'skipped', 'aborted', 'not executed', 'timeout', 'invalid'
