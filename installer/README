~~~ ~~~ Running the installer ~~~ ~~~

The installer must run as ROOT, with Python 2.7.

If you are installing the Twister Server, you should be connected to internet,
or ELSE, before running the installer, you must manually install :
 - Python-DEV and
 - python-mysql.

The Twister Client doesn't have any required dependencies; pExpect is optional.

The installer will guide you through all the steps, in order.

These are the steps :
1 - Select what you wish to install (client, server, or both)
2 - Select the user you want to install for (if there's only 1 user, this step is skipped)

Twister will be installed in the home of the selected user, in the folder `twister`.
If the folder is already present, you are asked to backup your data in order to continue,
because everything is DELETED, excepting the `config` folder.

Any dependencies that are old, or missing, will be downloaded and installed.
If all the requirements are met, the client or server files are copied, but nothing is installed.
