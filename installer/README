~~~ ~~~ Running the installer ~~~ ~~~

Requires Python 2.7 and a Linux machine. The installer doesn't run on Windows!
When installing the server, must run as ROOT! When installing the client, ROOT is optional.

When installing Twister for the first time, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to have an internet connection
and run as ROOT, to allow the setup of all the dependencies.

Any dependencies that are old, or missing, will be downloaded and installed.
If all the requirements are met, the client or server files are copied, but nothing is installed.

The installer will guide you through all the steps, in order.

These are the steps :
1 - Select what you wish to install (client, or server)
2 - Select the user you want to install for (if there's only 1 user, this step is skipped)

Twister Client will be installed in the home of your user, in the folder `twister`.
The server will be installed by default in `/opt/twister`.
