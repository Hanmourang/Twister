15th October changes:

- implemented a mechanism to execute scripts before starting the test cases and after their execution.
  The user can select the scripts using GUI to browse the files present on Twister server.
- many GUI changes to make the interface much user friendly and to offer more information needed during
  test case execution.
- implemente a mechanism for unit testing. A test case can be selected and executed alone. There is no
  need to define a suite with only one test case for that. The user selects the test from the available
  list and choose to do unit testing.
- plugin and backend code implemented for integration with Jira. By activating the Jira plugin, the
  user can create Jira issues from GUI. The login information ( Jira server/user/password ... ) is
  defined in GUI, inside the plugin
- OpenFlow 1.0 module included in Twister. The module can be used to do conformance testing against
  switches for OpenFlow protocol, version 1.0.1

30th July changes:

- implemented "stop on fail". If a test file fails, and the file is mandatory, and the "stop on fail"
  flag is activated, the execution process stops. The files that are optional must not stop the
  execution process if they fail. The "stop on fail" flag can be easily activated and deactivated.
- implemented "run temporary", a mechanism that allows 1 or more files to be run several times,
  without losing the stats from last run and without saving to database or sending e-mail report.
- better REST interface
- bug fixing.


16th July changes:

- implemented plugins for Central Engine and GUI
- added SVN plugin
- Central Engine REST interface for viewing logs and stats

  saved in database ( e.g. get a build version from a device and use it when the testing results are
  recorded in database ).
