6th December 2012 changes:

- updated the unit testing interface to be more user friendly and to offer more information
- implemented a mechanism so the user can specify what are the libraries ( modules ) that has to
  be imported by every suite. There is no point to send all the libraries ( modules ) to every 
  suite, since it might not need the library ( module )
- implemented a mechanism to save the CLI log per test case into the mysql database. This is very
  usefull in finding the possible issues when a test case fails.
- minor updates

- implemented a mechanism to execute scripts before starting the test cases and after their execution.
  The user can select the scripts using GUI to browse the files present on Twister server.
- many GUI changes to make the interface much user friendly and to offer more information needed during
  test case execution.
- implemente a mechanism for unit testing. A test case can be selected and executed alone. There is no
  need to define a suite with only one test case for that. The user selects the test from the available
  list and choose to do unit testing.
- plugin and backend code implemented for integration with Jira. By activating the Jira plugin, the
  user can create Jira issues from GUI. The login information ( Jira server/user/password ... ) is
  defined in GUI, inside the plugin
- OpenFlow 1.0 module included in Twister. The module can be used to do conformance testing against
  switches for OpenFlow protocol, version 1.0.1

  execution process if they fail. The "stop on fail" flag can be easily activated and deactivated.

  without losing the stats from last run and without saving to database or sending e-mail report.
