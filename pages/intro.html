<h2> What is Twister ? </h2>

<p> Bogdan Popescu Sep 12, 2012 </p>

<p> Hello dear reader! Welcome to the opening of Twister's blog! </p>

<p>We are very happy to introduce Twister, the open source test automation framework developed by Luxoft for the
enterprise telecommunication market. We focus our effort to make life easier and the work more productive to QA
engineers when it comes to testing telecommunication specific devices. And, why not, for the QA managers, too. </p>

<p>Let me explain first, why we started on this path to create a brand new testing framework. 
Our experience is more than 10 years conducting different test automation projects for all kind of telecommunication
devices from different vendors, so we've been in all kind of situations. 
We used different commercial testing frameworks that were promising to magically resolve testing issues and to make
this activity a walk in the park. We spent lot of time to understand and configure customized testing frameworks in
our labs. We built tools and integrated them in different frameworks to help us in daily work. During these
experiences (sometimes painful !), we had the chance (or opportunity ?) to discover all kind of issues and to think
solutions for them. This is how the idea of creating an automation testing framework started to evolve
towards a product.</p>

<p>This is how Twister started to get shape. There were long meetings and discussions about how to create a framework
that doesn't have all the issues that we noticed over the time. 
We kept in mind the situation when a lot of time was spent to customize different projects for our needs, so our
intention was to make this framework to be applied easily for new automation testing projects. Another key point for
us was to create an user friendly interface that allows the QA engineers to get familiar quickly with this tool.
Nobody wants to spend a lot of time to understand how a tool is working. If this can happen in very short time,
it will be much appreciated by the users.
Nevertheless, the framework was designed to offer a very nice interface for reporting and statistics.
We didn't forget about the times when QA managers spent time to aggregate the results in all kind of spreadsheets
that were useful for reporting and analysis. </p>

<p>And there are a lot more interesting things to be revealed about Twister ! </p>
<p>We'll do this in the next posts about Twister, so stay tuned !</p>
